      "30:I think this is a good opening, but I'm going to be a bit nit picky about it: I'm not sure about the repetition of \"simple\". I see the effect you're going for, but for the first line it stood out to me, and not in a strong way. \"A car either has to stop and wait, or run you down...\" — I'm not sure what I think about this, either. When the narrator talks to \"you,\" the reader, it can have the effect of throwing the reader out of the story (or hindering their ability to get into it, since this is the beginning). The opening doesn't have the character in it. How about something like that following: \"I stood in the middle of the road. Cars would either have to stop or run me down—and it wouldn't do for a hearse carrying the body of a former government official to accelerate towards me.\" It's not perfect. Possibly, it could use a stronger verb than \"stood,\" for example. But it puts the character and their action front and center, as well as cuts out a lot of unnecessary words, which puts the focus on the dramatic, attention-grabbing parts. Of course, see what others say about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "31:Things had simply collided, leaving me the perfect moment.\" — Just picking another nit, here: \"Things\" is a little weak. \"The route intersected with my walk to work, the police holding everyone back at the crossing so the cars could pass.\" — I think you can cut those words as unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:I looked around at...\" — You might want to consider revising this to avoid the filtering. John0 had done nothing to earn my respect.\" — This, too, seems a bit repetitive. I already got that idea from: \"We were expected to stand in silence, to be respectful, but Sam0 John0 never let us rest for one moment once he stepped into office. What right did he have to a peaceful forever?\" \"The police officer guarding the crossing was lookeding the other way, and I had one chance.\" — Reduces word count and removes a passive verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:The sky was cloudless and far-reaching above my head.\" — I wonder if you could rewrite this in a more active way? It stood out, especially because you recently began another paragraph in a similar way: \"The tarmac was warm beneath me, cooking in the sun.\" \"I wondered...\" — Consider removing the filtering. \"I knew I’d be heading to a police station rather than work when they moved me.\" — I think you can cut all that as unnecessary words. \"I was contemplateding whether they’d give me a chance to contact my flatmate and explain my absence at home, when I heard a yell.\" — Reduces word count and removes a passive verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "34:“Allyson,” I saidintroduced myself. “Thank you.” — It's clear that's she's introducing herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:I always try to avoid saying \"seemed\" in my own writing. I got a critique once that it knee caps our description and it's stuck with me. You're in charge of this world. Saying \"...she was dressed for work, in a pencil skirt...\" is much more impactful than having your narrator hem and haw over this description\n",
      "\n",
      "36:A bit of a clunky sentence and suggests cameras, not cops, were hauling her away. You've packed a lot into this sentence. It might be improved by making it more bite-size, breaking it up into two sentences. I'm trying to imagine the image: is she face-down or face-up? It's not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:I found this opening disorienting, which may have been your intention. At first I wondered how there could be a school building in Sam0 Can children go to Sam0 after all, or do the damned have children? Then I thought Penemue was remembering one of his days on Sam4 through a flashback, and about here is where I finally figured it out. Gormley works in the afterlife, so if that’s where the missing student went, he would know! at the idea of the employees in Sam0 having days off. Of course they'd barbecue. According to our traditional view of the place it’s about the only fun thing they can do down there. So they can cross over, then. At will?\n",
